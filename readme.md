# Google Sheet data + Mapbox map + Bootstrap style

## Google Sheet preparation

[From here](https://labs.mapbox.com/education/impact-tools/sheet-mapper/#create-data-in-google-sheet)

Once your table is complete, set sharing settings to 'Anyone with the link can view' so the data is visible without granting access to change it. To create an export link, copy the following link to a notepad or some other document to be used later:

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{key}/gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv&sheet={sheetname}

Replace {key} with your Google Sheet ID and {sheet_name} with the name of your sheet.
